# Codex-Experiment-Playground

This repository is a sandbox for exploring and experimenting with OpenAI Codex and related tooling.

## Goals
- Prototype small scripts and applications that demonstrate Codex's capabilities.
- Integrate and extend the **Codex Connector** from our recent work, using it as both motivation and starting point for new experiments.
- Document findings, best practices, and lessons learned through READMEs, issues, and pull requests.
- Provide templates and workflows to streamline contributions (issues/PRs) and ensure consistent project management.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for any sub‑projects as described in their respective directories.
3. Explore the examples and feel free to open issues or submit PRs for improvements.
